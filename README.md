## Overview

### Purpose of Statistical Analysis 

After using a bike share service to travel around New York City with our friend Kate, we've come up with the idea to open a similar bike share service in Des Moines, Iowa.  Kate has found a potential angel investor for this project, and now we need to present a proposal.  As part of this proposal we are analyzing existing data about the bike share service in NYC (Citi Bike) and how it works there, and using that to determine how this service might work in Des Moines and what the potential risks might be.  The data used for this analysis was collected during the month of August.
